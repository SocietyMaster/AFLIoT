\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}

In this paper, we present \sysname, a lightweight and easy deployable coverage-based fuzzing framework for Linux-based IoT devices. To our best knowledge, \sysname provides the first practical fuzzing solution for binary programs on IoT device. With binary level instrumentation, \sysname supports native execution of the target program on Linux-based IoT devices and therefore significantly reduces the performance overhead. We evaluate \sysname on both benchmarks and real-world IoT devices. Overall, \sysname is able to identify 157 unique crashes in 10 binary programs on 4 devices and only has 10\% performance overhead on average in comparison with AFL. Our evaluation shows that AFL-IoT is both efficient and effective to find software bugs in binary programs on Linux-based IoT devices.
